[ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, LIZARD, SPOCK]
=================

First :smile:

```
bower install;
```

An then:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer;
http://localhost:8000/main.html;
```
Or even:
```
file:///..../js-rpsls/main.html
```

The rest is pretty straightforward, just remember:
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* _(and as it always has)_ Rock crushes Scissors
